# Container Hackathon for Modellers
Atmosphere and ocean models are characterised by complex dependencies, external configurations, and performance requirements.
The objective to containerise such software stacks helps to provide a consistent environment to ensure security, portability and performance.
Since the container is built only once, but then can be deployed on multiple platforms, productivity is increased.
ETH Zurich provides subsequent Docker/Shifter support for the teams to complete the containerisation of their models.
